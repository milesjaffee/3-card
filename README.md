# 3-card

Accesses a tarot card, a Magic: The Gathering card (*this app is not in any way associated with Wizards of the Coast, LLC - this falls under their fan content policy!*), and a playing card.

This is a productivity/creativity tool, comparable to Brian Eno's [Oblique Strategies](https://stoney.sb.org/eno/oblique.html). Its purpose is to help you see a creative and/or problem-solving task in a new way. The idea is that, much like with regular tarot cards, having to read into the mysterious signs will help you bring out what you always had the capacity for.

## Possible uses

* Subjects for a free-association writing/drawing/acting/improv/etc warmup

* Where you've been at beforehand, where you need to go towards, and the sharpness of the change needed

* In terms of a fictional character, self-image, backstory, and social status

* Past, future, distance between past and future

* Single tarot card pull, "and oh those two other cards are there too"

* Cure for decision paralysis or writer's block

* Your own idiosyncratic use case!
